## Dependencies

I installed the supabase dependency using
```
yarn add supabase
```
but @Supaship believes only this should be necessary, and the fact that it isn't
is a bug that Supabase should resolve
```
yarn add -D supabase
```
Then I ran (second command failed without sudo on Ubuntu 20)
```
yarn supabase init
```

See https://mui.com/material-ui/guides/routing/ on how to use Material UI with react-router.
Here is an excerpt
```
<Router>
  <Link component={RouterLink} to="/">
    With prop forwarding
  </Link>
  <br />
  <Link component={LinkBehavior}>Without prop forwarding</Link>
</Router>
```

## Installation

sudo yarn supabase migration new starting-ddl

## Running

start
```
sudo yarn supabase start
```
stop
```
sudo yarn supabase stop
```
